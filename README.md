# Sankalpa

*Sankalpa* (Sanskrit): intention — a conscious decision to act.

A keyboard-first todo app for macOS. Fast, local, focused.

## Why

Speed protects flow. When a thought appears, you capture it instantly — no context switch, no mouse reach, no UI negotiation.

The Inbox holds intentions as they arise, so your mind doesn't have to. Clear your headspace for the task at hand, not for remembering what comes next.
